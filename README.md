# Mixed-Volume-of-Networks-with-Binomial-Steady-states
This code computes the mixed volume of a chemical reaction network under mass-action kinetics using code implemented in Macaulay2 (M2). If the network is partitionable and binomial, then the mixed volume can be computed as a matrix determinant (not implemented in M2). This code also checks if a network is partitionable and binomial.
